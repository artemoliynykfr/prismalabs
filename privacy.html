                produce a report on such Use.</p>

                is impaired or disabled. Among others we collect the following device identifiers:</p>

                For example, metadata may describe when and on which device your photo has been taken and how such photo
                is formatted. You may add or may have metadata added to your photos. Please note that metadata
                associated with your photos is deleted automatically with your photos within 24 hours after we apply
                styles to them.</p>

                amount and types of your Personal Data that are strictly required for the purposes mentioned in this
                Section 4 (&ldquo;<strong>data minimization principle</strong>&rdquo;).</p>

                access to, modification, correction, update, erasure or deletion of any Personal Data that you have
                provided to us and that we have about you. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we

            </p>
            <p><strong>EEA/UK residents</strong>. Individuals residing in the European Economic Area
                (&ldquo;<strong>EEA</strong>&rdquo;) and the United Kingdom (&ldquo;<strong>UK</strong>&rdquo;) have
                certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Data including under the General Data Protection Regulation
                (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (&ldquo;<strong>EEA GDPR</strong>&rdquo;) and the Data Protection, Privacy
                and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1586), as may be
                amended from time to time (&ldquo;<strong>UK GDPR</strong>&rdquo;) (collectively, the
                &ldquo;<strong>GDPR</strong>&rdquo;), including the rights specified below. You can exercise these
                rights by contacting us (for contact information, please, see How to Contact Us Section).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to your Personal Data and data portability</strong>. You have a right to
                    request information about whether we have any Personal Data about you, to access your Personal Data
                    (including in a structured and portable form) that you have provided to us, when Using Prisma and
                    that we have about you. You can do this by contacting us.</li>
                <li><strong>Rectification of your Personal Data and restriction of processing</strong>. You
                    are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your Personal Data that you provide to us. Inaccurate
                    information may affect your experience when Using Prisma features and our ability to contact you as
                    described in this Privacy Policy. If you believe that your Personal Data is inaccurate, you have a
                    right to contact us and ask us to correct such Personal Data. You also have the right to demand
                    restriction of processing of your Personal Data, if you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data
                    which inaccuracy is verified by us.</li>
                <li><strong>Erasure of your Personal Data</strong>. If you believe that your Personal Data
                    is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise
                    processed, or in cases where you have withdrawn your consent or object to the processing of your
                    Personal Data, or where the processing of your Personal Data does not otherwise comply with the
                    GDPR, you have the right to contact us and ask us to erase such Personal Data or by using a special
                    feature in Prisma settings. Please be aware that erasing some Personal Data may affect your ability
                    to Use Prisma.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object processing or otherwise using your Personal Data</strong>. You
                    can object to and stop us from processing or otherwise using your Personal Data by contacting us.
                    Please be aware that our inability to process or otherwise use some of your Personal Data may affect
                    your ability to Use Prisma.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification requirements</strong>. We commit to notify you promptly and your
                    data protection authority within the timeframe specified in applicable law (72 hours) about any
                    Personal Data breaches in relation to you.</li>
                <li><strong>Notice about automated decision-making</strong>. We use automated
                    decision-making tools (e.g. neural networks) that process your photos in order to provide you better
                    services through Prisma.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection Authorities</strong>. Subject to the GDPR, you have the right to
                    lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority about any of our activities that you
                    deem are not compliant with the GDPR.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please keep in mind that in case of a vague access, erasure, objection request or any other
                request in exercise of the mentioned rights we may engage you in a dialogue to better understand the
                motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. In case this is impossible, we reserve
                the right to refuse granting your request.</p>
            <p>Following the provisions of the GDPR, we might also ask you to prove your identity (for
                example, by requesting an ID or other proof) in order for you to invoke the mentioned rights. This is
                made to ensure that no right of third parties are violated by your request, and the mentioned rights are
                exercised by an actual Personal Data subject or an authorized person.</p>
            <p>Please note that we will grant your request within 30 days after receiving it, but it may take
                up to 90 days in some cases, for example for full erasure of your Personal Data stored in our backup
                systems - this is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data.</p>
            <p><strong>Opting Out of Promotional Emails</strong></p>
            <p>IF REQUIRED BY LAW, WE WILL ASK FOR YOUR CONSENT TO SEND YOU PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING EMAILS.
                IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF OUR PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING EMAILS, YOU CAN OPT OUT FROM OUR PROMOTIONAL AND
                MARKETING EMAIL LIST BY USING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>by following the opt-out links in any marketing email sent to you; or</li>
                <li>through Prisma settings on your mobile device; or</li>
                <li>by contacting us at any time using the contact details in How to Contact Us Section.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Bases for Using Your Personal Data</strong>. If you reside in the EEA or the UK we are
                only allowed to use your Personal Data when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called
                &ldquo;legal bases&rdquo; and we typically rely on one of four:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contract</strong>. One reason we might use your Personal Data is because you
                    formed a contract with us by accepting the Prisma <a href="/terms.html"><span>terms of use</span></a>, and use of
                    your Personal Data is necessary for the performance of the contract. For example, to enable you to
                    access and use Prisma or send you information that you have requested.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>. Another reason we might use your information is
                    because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your Personal Data to
                    operate, protect, improve and optimize Prisma and your User experience, such as to perform analytics
                    and conduct research.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent</strong>. In some cases we will ask for consent to use your Personal
                    Data for specific purposes. If we do, we will make sure you can revoke your consent in Prisma
                    settings or by contacting us.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong>. We may be required to use your Personal Data to
                    comply with the law, for example, when we need to take action to protect our Users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>. If you are a California resident, California
                law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your Personal Data. To learn more about
                your California privacy rights, visit (i) <a

            <p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control</strong>. If we sell or otherwise
                transfer part or the whole of the Company or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of
                a transaction like a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, acquisition, bankruptcy,
                dissolution, liquidation), your Personal Data and any other collected information may be among the items

                share your information in response to a legal (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena),
                government or regulatory request if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This
                may include responding to legal, government or regulatory requests from jurisdictions outside of the
                United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that
                jurisdiction, affects Users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized
                standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is
                necessary to: (i) detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; (ii) protect ourselves,
                you and others, including as part of investigations; and (iii) prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

                when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations
                concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
            <h3>7. DATA SECURITY</h3>
            <p>We use reasonable and appropriate information security safeguards to help keep the collected
                information secure and to secure it from accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration and
                disclosure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
                Although we do our best to protect your collected information, we cannot guarantee the security of the
                collected information transmitted to or through Prisma or an absolute guarantee that such information
                may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Any transmission of your collected information is
                at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of security measures contained in Prisma.
                Please understand that there is no ideal technology or measure to maintain 100% security. Among others,
                we utilize the following information security measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Pseudominization of certain categories of your Personal Data.</span>
                </li>
                <li><span>Encryption of your Personal Data in transit and in rest.</span></li>

                        those in charge of data management get access to your Personal Data and only for limited
                        purposes required for the operation of Prisma. We impose strict liability on such employees for
                        any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions and misuses of your Personal
                        Data.</span></li>

                        also commit to undertake privacy audit in case of the Company&rsquo;s merger or takeover.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Your privacy settings may
                also be affected by changes the social media services, through which you may share your photos, make to
                their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy or security measures of any other
                organization.</p>

                your Personal Data, we may continue to retain and use aggregated or anonymous data previously collected

                be as comprehensive or offer the same protections as the laws in your country. For example, personal
                data transferred to the United States and Cyprus may be subject to lawful access requests by legal
                authorities. You nevertheless consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to the United States, Cyprus

            <p>In appropriate cases, the Company will enter into standard contractual clauses as approved
                under the European Commission Decision C(2010)593 or decision 2004/915/EC, as applicable, to permit the
